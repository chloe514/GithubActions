Documentation for GitHub Actions Workflow
Purpose of Workflows
The primary purpose of this GitHub Actions workflow is to automate the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) processes for the application hosted on Heroku. By utilizing GitHub Actions, we ensure that:

Code is automatically built and tested on every push to the master branch.
The application is automatically deployed to Heroku after successful builds, streamlining the development process and reducing the risk of human error during deployment.
Steps Involved
Checkout Code: The workflow starts by checking out the latest code from the repository.
Set Up JDK: It sets up the Java Development Kit (JDK) using the AdoptOpenJDK (or a similar distribution) to ensure compatibility with the application code.
Build with Maven: The code is built using Maven, running mvn clean install to compile the application and resolve dependencies.
Deploy to Heroku: If the build is successful, the application is deployed to Heroku by pushing the code to the Heroku remote repository.
Configurations or Dependencies
Java Version: The application is built with Java 17, specified in the pom.xml file.
Maven: The project uses Maven as the build tool, and it must be included in the project's configuration.
Heroku API Key: The deployment process requires a Heroku API key stored securely as a GitHub secret (named HEROKU_API_KEY) to authenticate the deployment.
Conclusion
This GitHub Actions setup enhances the development workflow by automating testing and deployment, ensuring that code changes are efficiently built and deployed to production.
